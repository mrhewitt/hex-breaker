# 20 Game Challenge : Hex Breaker

Game #2'ish (again!) in my attempt at the [20 game challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/) - Hex Breaker!

A breakout type game, but more in a "puzzle" style than arcade style, no paddle movement.

A grid of hex shaped bricks move progressively lower, filling up from the top, while in each
turn you launch balls at a selected angle to attempt to destroy them. The number of balls
you have available to you increases with each round, and from additional bonus pickup 

See it in action on Itch.io:  [Hex Breaker](https://daddio-dragonslayer.itch.io/hex-breaker)
