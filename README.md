# 20 Game Challenge : Hex Breaker

Game #2'ish (again!) in my attempt at the [20 game challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/) - Hex Breaker!

A breakout type game, but more in a "puzzle" style than arcade style, no paddle movement.

A grid of hex shaped bricks move progressively lower, filling up from the top, while in each
turn you launch balls at a selected angle to attempt to destroy them. The number of balls
you have available to you increases with each round, and from additional bonus pickup 

TBD: See it in action on Itch.io:  [Hex Breaker](https://daddio-dragonslayer.itch.io/)

Prototype only for now
